# startup-directory
The official CBC Startup Directory is meant to catalogue and create visibility for cryptocurrency and blockchain based startups that are either headquartered in the greater Chicago area, or have a presence here otherwise.

Any ammendments to the directory will be processed first by the CBC team before joining the public directory. 

More updates to come!
